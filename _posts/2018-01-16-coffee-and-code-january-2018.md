Hopefully the second week of school is going well for everyone! If it is or it
isn’t, Ada’s Team is hosting a Coffee && Code this **Friday, January 19th ,
from 2:30pm to 4:30pm** in the Heritage Lounge in Athabasca Hall to cheer you
up!

We’ll have warm beverages and some snacks to share with you to create a
comfortable atmosphere for meeting new people, discussion, and coding (of
course)! Get to know the members of Ada’s Team, talk with us and others about
Computing Science related topics, or just sit down and get some work done!

There will be coffee, tea, and snacks
