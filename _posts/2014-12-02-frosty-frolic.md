![](https://i2.wp.com/christmasstockimages.com/free/decorations/slides/purple_christmas_decorations.jpg)To
help get everyone in the Holiday spirit the Computing Science department is
resurrecting the tradition of the Frosty Frolic, also known as the
Department’s End-of-Year Celebration, on Friday, December 5 at 2:30 pm in
Heritage Lounge. CSGSA is helping host the event and has invited us to help!
So we’re all going to be there with treats and snacks and activities.

This is a potluck get-together for the holiday season, where everyone
attending should bring a food item (savory or sweet) to share. Beverages will
be provided.

Additionally, this is a party to celebrate all the differing
holidays/traditions people have for this time of year. We encourage everyone
to bring pictures or traditions from their own lives to share at the event.

Please join us this Friday to give yourself a little break and have a little
fun with the department of Computing Science.
