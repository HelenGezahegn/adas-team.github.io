Sarah was thinking of organizing a weekly come-eat-your lunch in CSC 1st floor
lounge area. To help organize what days to schedule these lunches, please
enter your availability in the following when2meet:

Donâ€™t worry about the exact dates (e.g. Sept 11) just enter your availability
for days in general (e.g. Mondays).
