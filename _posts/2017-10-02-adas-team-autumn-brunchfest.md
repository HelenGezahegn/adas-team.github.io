We here at Ada’s Team are returning last year’s extravagant Autumn Feast in
the setting of a delicious and social Brunchfest! Our sights are set on
celebrating with you, the insights on this year’s office space, event
programming and volunteering opportunities!

Come join us this Tuesday, OCT 3RD, 11am – 1pm @ Heritage Lounge in Athabasca
Hall.

**Meet the Execs!**

Fall 2017/18 has a new executive team (and mascot!) who work hard to promote
under-represented groups and allies in computing science and technology. Come
put name to face and ask us about Ada’s Team!

**Feast Upon This!**

An assortment of food and drink (non-alcoholic) arrangements with
consideration to meat dishes, vegetarian plates and vegan picks! And we didn’t
forget gluten free!  
And a fabulous ‘Duchess Cake’ from Edmonton’s lovely ‘Duchess Bakery Shop’ ❤

**Mingling Activities + Prizes!**

We do our best to make our feast events attend-able for busy UofA students and
staff. Thus, we will be hosting mingling activities at the start of 11pm and
12pm. Come during one of these time slots to get the most of your Ada’s Team’s
Autumn Brunchfest!
