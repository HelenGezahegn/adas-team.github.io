Hi Ada’s Team!

Have you ever had a burning question you wanted to ask a member of an
underrepresented group about what it’s like to work in tech?

**THIS FRIDAY** is your chance!

CSGSA and Ada’s Team have gathered 5 members of our CS department and the
Edmonton tech industry to openly discuss issues facing members of these groups
and the reality of being “different”.

**When:** **Friday, November 10, 2017 from 3:00 pm to 4:30 pm.**

**Venue:** **Computing Science Centre, CSC B-02.**

**Food:** Pastries, finger foods and light refreshments.

See you all there!
