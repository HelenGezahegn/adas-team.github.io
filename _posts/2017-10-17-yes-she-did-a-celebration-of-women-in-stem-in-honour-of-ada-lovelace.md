Hello Ada’s Team Members!

In honour of Ada Lovelace, and the international Ada Lovelace Day celebrated
annually on the second Tuesday of October, Heather Baker and Tess Lamer invite
you to participate in a celebration of women in STEM!

All students, postdocs, professors, and their friends and role models are
invited for an evening to celebrate the accomplishments of past and current
women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).

Heather and Tess are excited to announce that the Keynote Speaker will be Dr.
Margaret-Ann Armour, Associate Dean of Faculty of Science of Diversity at the
Univeristy of Alberta and the founder of WISEST- Women in Scholarship,
Engineering, Science, and Technology. Dr. Armour is an award-winning scientist
and has dedicated her life to the inclusion of women in science and
engineering.

Attendees are also encouraged to bring a picture, description, name, or object
representing any woman who inspires them. This will be added to a collage and
displayed for campus to enjoy!

Please RSVP if you would like to attend. Feel free to contact Heather Baker
with any questions or suggestions for the evening. Everyone is welcome, as
long as you RSVP. The event will take place on October 25th, from 5:00pm –
7:30pm.

This event was inspired by the Ada Lovelace Day events that took place
internationally on October 10th as well as “She Did That”, an Ada Lovelace
inspired event put on by the University of Toronto in 2016.

Ada’s Team hopes you are interested in this event and hopes to see you there!
