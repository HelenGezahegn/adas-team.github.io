[Grace Hopper Conference
Checklist](https://docs.google.com/a/ualberta.ca/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqShEGXHbf6BdFV5R2xDZjhjVUJaRmtlMWRsNFBocVE&usp=sharing
"Grace Hopper Conference Checklist")

Next to your name are a bunch of columns corresponding to tasks that you must
complete if you want to go on this conference. Hover over the column heading
if you need a description for what each column is asking of you. In most cases
you’ll answer Y/N so that we know if you’ve done these things. In the case of
accommodations, if you’re staying with the group in the swank pad that Sarah
has set up, please indicate “Y” and if you are arranging your own housing,
please indicate where you’ll be staying so that we know.

This spreadsheet is only visible to members of the group so if you click the
link and it doesn’t work for you, please email Sarah and we’ll figure out how
to give you access.
