This week, Ada’s Team was proud to be a part of WISEST’s annual [Choices
Conference](http://www.wisest.ualberta.ca/Programs/ChoicesConference.aspx) for
6th grade girls.

“The Choices Conference began in 1991 and now brings up to 600 Grade Six Girls
together to discover the wonders of science, engineering and technology for
themselves.” – [WISEST](http://www.wisest.ualberta.ca/)

Ada’s Team volunteers led students through two activities: Robots Rock and
[Ada’s Arduinos](https://adasarduinos.wordpress.com/2014/02/10/cat-ears/).

**Robots Rock** informed students of the variety of robots that exist and
taught students how to program using [Lego Mindstorms](http://www.lego.com/en-
us/mindstorms/about-ev3)’ drag-and-drop programming language. After mastering
the basics moves, students were challenged to navigate their robot through a
maze and to program their robot to dance.

**Ada’s Arduinos** showed students how to build a pair of animatronic cat ears
using a microcontroller, some electronics components, and a little bit of
computing know-how. The ears were programmed to show “cat emotions”. Students
made custom cat ears from craft supplies, wired up their Arduinos, debugged
code, and programmed new cat emotions.
