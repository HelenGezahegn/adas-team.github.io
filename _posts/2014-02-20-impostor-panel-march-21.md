**When:** March 21 3pm -6pm

**Where:** University of Alberta, CCIS L1 – 160

**What:** [Impostor Syndrome
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)is when you struggle to
internalize your own accomplishments and you feel like you are “faking it” and
are about to be uncovered as a fraud. It affects many people who achieve
success but it can really impact women and underrepresented minorities in STEM
fields like Computing Science and Engineering. People who feel like they don’t
belong in STEM are less likely to stay in a program of study, they tend not to
apply for awards or scholarships, they may hold themselves back from positions
of power, they won’t apply for the best jobs and negotiate good salaries, the
list goes on.

The Impostor Panel is designed to combat Impostor Syndrome. We want
undergrads, grad students, staff and faculty members to be aware of it and how
it can prevent them from participating fully in academia and in industry. We
have invited prominent women from the community to talk about times when they
felt like they didn’t belong or felt self-doubt, times when they persevered
and overcame and tell us about their personal heroes. There will be a question
period open to the audience.

So far we have booked the following awesome speakers to be panelists:

  * [Margaret-Ann Armour](http://news.ualberta.ca/newsarticles/2010/12/margaretannarmournamedoneofcanadastop100mostpowerfulwomen) – Associate Dean of Diversity at the UofA
  * [Eleni Stroulia](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~stroulia/index.old.html) – Prof of Computing Science at the UofA
  * [Noreen Hoskins](http://www.startupcan.ca/who-is-involved/provincial-ambassadors-committees/noreen-hoskins/) – TEC Edmonton, Startup Canada
  * [Jessica Vandenberghe](http://www.syncrude.ca/users/folder.asp?FolderID=8629) – P.Eng, M.Sc. Director of Outreach and Product Services at APEGA
  * [Jackie Foord](http://www.thewandereronline.com/2013/12/13/jackie-foord-chief-executive-officer-ywca/) CEO of YWCA Edmonton
