Some of you may recall that _way back_ in April 2017, Calvin Beck, Computing
Science graduate of University of Alberta and longtime Ada’s Team member gave
a talk entitled “A Journey Through Types”.

In this talk Calvin informed, terrified and enlightened us.

Using Python, Java, Haskell and Idris as reference languages we learned about
the importance of types — including how they can help us to write better and
safer code.
