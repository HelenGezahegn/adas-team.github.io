Ada’s Team is back from the 2013 Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in
Computing (GHC 2013).

We’re running a series of posts written by the women who attended GHC 2013
about their impressions of the conference – a speaker who really inspired
them, a career path they learned about, companies they interviewed with at the
career fair, an activity or session they think would be good to do locally at
the UofA, and/or a funny or interesting story that happened during the
conference.
