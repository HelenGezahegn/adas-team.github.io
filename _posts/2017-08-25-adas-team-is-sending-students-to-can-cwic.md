Hello Ada’s Team! It’s been a long summer!

**Computing Science students will be going to the Canadian Celebration of
Women in Computing (CAN-CWiC).** The conference will take place in Montreal,
Quebec from November 3rd to 4th, 2017 at the Sheraton Hotel. Students will
leave on either the 2nd or 3rd of November and return on the 5th of November.

If you would like **first priority** consideration to attend CAN-CWIC, you
need to fill out the attached google form by **Wednesday August 30th
11:59PM**. This is because the registration to CAN-CWiC opens September 1st,
so **any students that apply after the 30th are not guaranteed a spot in the
conference.** Students will be notified on August 31st if they will receive
full sponsorship to CAN-CWiC.

However, if you are unable to apply by the deadline above, you will still be
considered for funding if you apply before **Friday September 8th 11:59PM.**

Please note:

  * Since this conference takes place in Canada, international students do not need a visa to attend.
  * While we are happy for all students to join us on our trip, we will **only be able to consider undergraduates and first year masters students** for funding. All senior masters students and PhD students should consider approaching their supervisors for funding.

If you have any specific questions on the application, please email
