Next Monday, Nov 18th at 5pm in CSC 3-33, Ada’s Team will be hosting a
screening of[ Miss Representation](http://film.missrepresentation.org/). Miss
Representation is a 85 minute documentary that explores the under-
representation of women in positions of power and influence in America and
challenges the media’s limited portrayal of what it means to be a powerful
woman.

Click[ here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gkIiV6konY) to see the official
trailer.

We figure the movie will finish around 6:30pm, so afterwards, we can go to
RATT (or [Urban Diner](http://www.urbandiner.com/cms/) on 109th) to eat dinner
together, discuss the movie, and just hang out.

Please feel free to join for just the movie, just the dinner afterwards, or
both. If you want to come to the dinner but not the movie, please come to CSC
3-33 by 6:30pm so that you’ll be with the group when we decide where to go.

Hope to see you all there!
