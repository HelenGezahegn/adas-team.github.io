Please join us for an Ada’s Team Coffee & Code Event!

If you have some code to work on, whether it’s for school or a personal
project, come join us on **Friday, November 28, from 3:00pm to 5:30 pm in CSC
B-10**. This is an event where you can work on whatever project you want and
enjoy the company of your fellow coders. Who knows, maybe the person sitting
beside you knows exactly what library you need to look into, or you might be
able to find their weird syntax bug!

Everyone is welcome, no matter what language or text editor they’re using ;).

Yellow Pencil is sponsoring this event. To learn more about this cool local
web dev company, check out their website <http://yellowpencil.com/>. Bonus
easter egg, you can find the profile for awesome U of A CS alum Kim Beaudin,
and see her blog posts on Yellow Pencil’s blog, including one about her trip
to Grace Hopper this year.

We look forward to seeing you there!
