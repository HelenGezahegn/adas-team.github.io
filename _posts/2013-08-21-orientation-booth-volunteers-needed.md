"Orientation booth volunteers needed!")

We are on the waiting list for an orientation booth. At any time, we might get
a call that we’ll actually get a spot and then we have to guarantee that we
have people manning the booth when they say they want us to be there. But
because we aren’t sure when that might be, we need to know what availability
people have during the first week of school in case we need you “on call”. Can
you fill out when you’re free on this when2meet and we’ll let you know if
we’ll need you as soon as we find out? Thanks so much!
