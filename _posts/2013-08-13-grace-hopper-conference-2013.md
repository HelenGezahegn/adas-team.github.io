This year Ada’s Team is sending a team of 15 graduate and undergraduate
students to the Grace Hopper Celebration for Women in Computing Science 2013
in Minneapolis, MN. We will be attending the conference from Oct 1st to Oct
5th 2013!

The Grace Hopper Celebration for Women in Computing Science is described as:

> Co-founded by Dr. Anita Borg and Dr. Telle Whitney in 1994 and inspired by
the legacy of[Admiral Grace Murray
Hopper](http://gracehopper.org/2011/about/about-grace-hopper/), the
Institute’s Grace Hopper Celebration (GHC) Of Women In Computing Conference is
designed to bring the research and career interests of women in computing to
the forefront. It is the largest technical conference for women in computing
and results in collaborative proposals, networking and mentoring for junior
women and increased visibility for the contributions of women in computing.
Conference presenters are leaders in their respective fields, representing
industry, academia and government. Top researchers present their work while
special sessions focus on the role of women in today’s technology fields.

As a representatives of the University of Alberta we hope to expand the
reputation, network and visibility of our university, as well as extend our
own academic, professional, and technical skill sets. The University of
Alberta will be exhibiting at the conference, and Ada’s Team will be helping
out at our booth!
