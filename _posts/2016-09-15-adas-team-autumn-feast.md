In celebration of the new Fall term, Ada’s Team has prepared a welcoming feast
for undergraduates, graduates and members of the CS department on **Friday,
September 23rd from 2-5pm** in the **Heritage Lounge of Athabasca Hall.**

Our aim of the Autumn Feast will be to welcome members, new and old, to mingle
in a comfortable and socially constructive environment. This primarily
includes, but is not limited to, the diversity of people, technology, and
computer science.

If there are concerns in allergies or food preferences, please let us know
down in the RSVP link below.

In order to spread the outreach of diversity, technology and Ada’s Team, we
look forward to your participation. We hope you will take part in the event to
make it a great success! Please RSVP if you intend to attend (this way we will
know how many people to feed)!
