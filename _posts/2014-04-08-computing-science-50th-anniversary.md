On April 1st the University of Alberta Computing Science Department celebrated
it’s 50th anniversary.

I was blown away by how many students, alumni and faculty showed up to attend
the event!

I just wanted to express some pride in our department and congratulate CS on a
great 50 years.

As well keep your eyes open for the new issue of [Contours – which will be
highlighting 50 years in CS.](http://science.ualberta.ca/about-us/contours)
