On January 22, 2016 our delegation will arrive Ottawa along with hundreds of
women in tech from all across Canada.

“CAN-CWiC 2016 will unite technical women from across Canada for networking,
mentoring and planning for Canada’s technical future. The conference will
inspire women at all points in their careers – from first year students to
senior technical women with years of industrial experience. The career fair
will provide an excellent opportunity for companies to recruit technical
talent from across Canada.”  – [CAN-CWiC](http://www.can-cwic.ca/)
