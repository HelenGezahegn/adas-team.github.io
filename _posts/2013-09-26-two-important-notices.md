**Please come to AI lab (CSC 2-11)** sometime on Monday between 9am-6pm to
pick up a bag of stuff. We’re distributing the swag among as many people as we
can so that not one person is responsible for hauling a million pounds of
swag.

If you are in Minneapolis on Saturday, **would you like to go to a climbing
gym for $20?** If so, please email Kit so that we can get a group deal.

**Please fill in your availability to monitor a Grace Hopper Booth:**

**Accommodations in Minneapolis are at the following location:**  
5225 and 5227B Minnetonka Blvd  
Minneapolis, MN 55416

**Here’s the GHC App on iTunes**  
<https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ghc-2013/id605631584?mt=8>

**Save all your receipts, original boarding passes (or e-boarding passes) to
get reimbursed.**

**Stay tuned** to find out where we are meeting in the Minneapolis airport on
Tuesday to get a ride to the accommodations.
