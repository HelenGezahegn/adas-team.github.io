![Coffee & Code Invite]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2015-01-27-coffee-code-
jan-29-2014/coffee-and-code-jan-29-1.jpg)Please join us for an Ada’s Team
Coffee & Code Event!

What is a Coffee & Code Event? It’s an open space for people to come and work
on any code or work they have on the go, while simultaneously enjoying the
company of their fellow coders. It’s a great opportunity to learn more about
other languages or projects out there, meet new people, and possibly get some
help with that bug that just won’t die!

Interested? Come join us on Thursday, January 29, from 4:00pm to 6:00 pm in
CSC 3-33.

We look forward to seeing you there!
