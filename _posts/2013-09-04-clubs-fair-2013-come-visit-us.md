Sarah and Dan featured above, showing off all the games, robots, candy, and
cables on display at the amazing Ada’s Team booth!

What is the SGS Clubs Fair? [Well it’s a wonderful place where you can see all
the amazing student groups on campus out strutting their
stuff.](http://www.su.ualberta.ca/services/studentgroups/events/clubsfair/)

As part of this event Ada’s Team was giving away **candy** and **cat 6 network
cables** Monday and Tuesday. But don’t worry if you missed out!! We will be
set up in Quad this Friday from 10 am – 3 pm for round 2!

But that’s not all!! As part of our fabulous display Neesha programmed a
really fun Ualberta locator game as a clever way to get people to sign up for
our group.

You can play the[ game here if you missed out
today!](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~neesha/astar/ualbertaLocator.html)

So if you are not yet a member, and love coding, making, hacking, mathing, or
tech stop by this Friday to sign-up! Or just say hello to some of our awesome
volunteers!

❤
