As part of [Rainbow Welcome
Week](http://www.prideweek.ualberta.ca/RainbowWelcome), Ada’s Team will be
hosting an Intro to Arduinos workshop. The workshop will be held in **CSC
1-53** on **Tuesday, September 20** from **2 PM – 3:30 PM.**

Participants will build a pair of animatronic cat ears using a
microcontroller, some electronics components, and a little bit of computing
know-how. The ears will be programmed to show “cat emotions”. Participants
will make custom cat ears from craft supplies, wire up their Arduinos,
debugged code, and programmed new cat emotions. This workshop is a great
opportunity for introducing people to computing science as it is a *very
exciting* and a *tactile* experience – no prior knowledge of computing science
required!

This opportunity is available for FREE!  
We have equipment for at most 20 participants.
