Way back in February 2017, Leah Hackman, a Computing Science PD student and
longtime Ada’s Team member gave an amazing talk entitled “Just Press Send”.

In this talk, Leah gave practical advice (and encouragement!) about two often
daunting tasks:

  1. Asking a professor for a reference letter, and
  2. Asking a professor to apply for an NSERC USRA with you

After much delay, the talk is available here:

So please, even if you are not sure if research is for you, or you are not
currently in need of a reference letter, check out these slides. And tell your
friends. There are some great tips in here!

And lastly, a personal testimonial: Before I attended this talk, I had no
intention of applying to be a summer research assistant. A few days later,
after mulling it over, I was convinced. I studied the slides, wrote up an
email, held my breath, and pressed send. The professor was willing to apply
for an NSERC USRA with me, and although ultimately, I was not awarded an
NSERC, the professor was able to find alternative funding for me!
